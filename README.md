You can encrypt / decrypt / view files using the Ansible Vault binary.

It supports the encrypt_string with Ansible 2.3.X, it was tested on Mac OS X ans Linux platforms.

This plugin was inspired from the Ansible Vault plugin from [adambullmer](https://github.com/adambullmer/sublime_ansible_vault)

## Usage

### Tools > AVault > Encrypt

If you have selected one or more values it will use the ansible_encrypt method and update the current file.

If nothing is selected it will encrypt the whole current file.

### Tools > AVault > Decrypt

If you have selected one or more values it will use Ansible to decrypt the data and update the current file.

If nothing is selected it will look the file for any !vault | ... string to decrypt, if nothing is found it will try to decrypt the full file.

### Tools > AVault > View

*It is only working on full encrypted file*

It will open a new readonly file on a different tab.
